                        This information is based off data taken in 2014 from <a href = "https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">U. S. Census Data</a>.

                        Strong evidence linking income and health suggests that policies promoting economic equity may have broad health effects.

                      Poverty has long been recognized as a contributor to death and disease, but several recent trends have generated an increased focus on the link between income and health. First, income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically in recent decades, while health indicators have plateaued, and life expectancy differences by income have grown.

                    <p>
                      Second, there is growing scholarly and public recognition that many nonclinical factors—education, employment, race, ethnicity, and geography—influence health outcomes. Third, health care payment and delivery system reforms have encouraged an emphasis on addressing social determinants of health, including income.

                    </p>

                    <p> The data findings reveal that higher income does lead to a healthier living situation.
